\section{Further Works on the project}
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Smartphone application development}\\ Even if the current web application is working in a proper way also using a smartphone's browser, would be interesting and useful to let it be available like application for the main current software platforms (iOS, Android).
\item \textbf{Visibility of a timetable}\\
Would be useful to provide the possibility of change a timetable's visibility, such as:
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Public: All the users can't view and join the timetable.
	\item Private: A user can view and join the timetable just if they receive the permission directly from the timetable's owner.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Extra features about events}
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Description: Add an extra field during the creation of an event that allows the owner of the event to add a description about it, in order to provide more information about it.
	\item Comments: Give the user the possibility to add a comment to an event that is following.
	\item Follow a single event: Provides an user to follow a single event without be forced to follow the whole timetable.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Further improvements on the teamwork}
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Group coding} \\ The time we spent coding all together resulted very productive. Unfortunately it happened just few times because of the each single team member's schedules. For further improvements about the teamwork would be very useful to arrange out more group-coding sessions.
