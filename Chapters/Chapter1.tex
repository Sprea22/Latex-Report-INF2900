\section{Aim of the course}
\vspace{-5mm}
This Software engineering course has an important background goal, to learn how to work in teams to create software using an agile software development process.\\ \\
Seeing as the development uses the web application framework Ruby on Rails, the teams will also have to learn to use this framework, discovering its potential and utilities. This includes using multiple programming languages like Ruby, HTML and CSS.

\section{Aim of the project}
\vspace{-5mm}
One of the most difficult things in a students life is to properly plan meetings, lectures, sports, and other events, especially when these activities are shared between multiple people. For this reason the aim of this project is to implement an online scheduler. A scheduler is an instrument that organizes or maintains schedules, meaning lists of planned activities, keeping track of what needs to be done and when.

The initial idea was to provide an online service in order to help students with daily time organization issues, but it could also be used in other contexts, such as team training sessions, meetings between friends, and public events.

The web application implementation will try to reach the following objectives:
