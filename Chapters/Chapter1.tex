\section{Aim of the project}

Thinking of actual students' problems, we tried to find a solution to some of them. We have developed a whole  online platform for any group of people able to share a calendar. Our aim was to provide them with a tool that could organize  different schedules, being able to show each schedule separately or as a whole calendar that includes all the events.\\
Although our first target was students, the platform can be used by everyone who need an organizer. The only requirement a person needs is creating an account and he or she will be able to create a timetable and share it with people to join it.\\
People who join a timetable will be able to see the whole calendar but, obviously, they will not be able to edit it. by doing this, we have ensured the safety of a timetable.  In addition, in order to maintain the confidentiality of our users, the content of the website cannot be seen by someone without an account.\\
With the aim of helping new users to create accounts and to learn how to use the application, we have completely filled the Help and About pages. Furthermore, in case some question could not be answered through these pages, an email account has been created for contacting us.\\

\section{Aim of the course}
One of the purposes of this project was to learn how to work together in a cooperative environment. Some of the challenges we have successfully faced to are: sharing code, dealing with different schedules or finding a common idea of what to do and how to do it. We have learnt that having a meeting once per week is unavoidable for sharing ideas, problems and struggles, asking for help and being updated.\\
Finally, another important objective consisted on learning to use the framework Ruby on Rails. We found that it is such a powerful web developer, hard to use for the first time, but very sensitive to any change. That is, with so few code lines you can make big changes in your application. In addition, compared with others frameworks, it is quite easy to put together the logic with the graphics: Ruby helps you as much as a software can.
